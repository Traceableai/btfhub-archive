# btfhub-archive

BTFHub Archive provides BTF files for existing published kernels that don't support embedded BTF.

The main repository can be found at [https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub).

Issues and PRs should go there, as this repository is automatically updated from that one.
